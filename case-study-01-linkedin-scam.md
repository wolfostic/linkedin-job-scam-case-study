## Targeted Job Scam via LinkedIn Using a Fake Recruiter Profile

## Summary
In May 2025, I was targeted by a phishing scam that impersonated a recruiter from a legitimate company. The scam involved a convincing LinkedIn profile, an authentic-looking job listing, and a job offer without an interview or screening.

## Disclaimer

This case study describes a job scam that involved the impersonation of Acushnet Company, a legitimate and respected organization. It is important to note that Acushnet had no involvement in the scam and was not responsible for the fraudulent messages or job offer. After direct communication with the official Acushnet HR department, the company confirmed that the job offer and recruiter were not affiliated with them in any 
way.

This report is shared solely for educational and awareness purposes, to help job seekers recognize and avoid similar employment scams in the future.


## Timeline of Events
•	May 2025: I applied for an IT Help Desk Support (Remote) position posted on LinkedIn under Acushnet Company’s name.

•	The same day, I received a LinkedIn message from someone claiming to be a recruiter for the role. Below is the exact message I received, which appeared polished and professional: 

_Join Our Team: IT Help Desk Support (Remote) Position_

_Dear [My Name],_

_We are currently seeking qualified candidates for the Information Technology Help Desk Support (Remote) position. If you’re passionate about delivering top-tier technical assistance and thrive in a virtual environment, we’d love to hear 
from you._

_Please email your most recent résumé to hr@staffingexpert.online with the subject line “IT Help Desk Support (Remote) Application.”_

_We look forward to reviewing your qualifications and will be in touch regarding next steps._

_Best regards,_

_Sr. Recruiter_

•	The message was polite; the LinkedIn profile looked real (Premium status, complete work history, followers, endorsements, and connections), and I was asked to send my resume to hr@staffingexpert.online.

•	I replied, confirming, and emailed my resume to the provided address.

•	Three days later, I was offered the job without any interview or technical screening.

•	This raised suspicion, which led me to verify the offer with the official company through their corporate website.

•	Before emailing, I noticed a notice on the official site warning about scammers impersonating Acushnet associates on platforms including LinkedIn and Indeed.

•	After sending the email, about half an hour later, I received a response from the official Acushnet Recruiting Team confirming that the recruiter and job offer were fraudulent.

The message stated:

_"We regret to inform you that the message you received is part of a 'phishing' scam, where the scammer is posing as an Acushnet associate in order to steal from and/or trick people into revealing sensitive information. You should cease all contact with the scammer immediately and 'block' the account from sending further messages."_

In addition, they provided a detailed set of security precautions, including:

    o	Change your passwords for any affected accounts.

    o	Scan and remove any malware from your devices.

    o	Notify your bank and credit card companies to secure your accounts.

    o	Monitor all financial activity closely for signs of fraud.

    o	Report the phishing incident to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) via ReportFraud.ftc.gov.

This response confirmed the scam and demonstrated how impersonators can use seemingly legitimate accounts to deceive applicants.


## Red Flags Identified

•	Redirected off-platform: Although the messaging occurred via LinkedIn, I was asked to send my resume to an external email address not connected to the LinkedIn job post or application system.

•	Unusual email domain: The address ended in .online instead of a similar staffing agency with a .com domain.

•	No interview: A legitimate offer was extended without screening.

•	Too quick to hire: The whole process was unusually fast; it took only three days after I applied for an offer.

•	Too-good-to-be-true compensation: Compensation appeared unusually high ($25–$40/hr) for part-time remote work with flexible hours. A common tactic in employment scams is to lure quick responses via high compensation.

•	 Mismatch with official website: The scam domain staffingexpert.online resolved to IP address 91.195.240.123 and used DNS services from dnsowl.com, which are not linked to the legitimate company’s infrastructure. Additionally, WHOIS records showed generic DNS and mail exchange (MX) servers (mx1.titan.email, mx2.titan.email), indicating this domain was likely registered recently or by a third party and hosting a placeholder or parked site rather than a legitimate staffing agency corporate domain.

    As of [6/1/2025], the domain no longer appears in WHOIS records or resolves to an active site, consistent with common scammer tactics of abandoning or dropping domains once exposed.

•	Company warning: The real company posted a fraud warning about fake recruiters.

•	Suspicious profile image: The recruiter’s profile photo raised concerns (e.g., generic appearance, lack of reverse image matches), and I used AI image detection tools, which returned inconclusive or mixed results(the image did not clearly appear AI-generated). While not definitive, the image contributed to the 
overall suspicion.


## Verification Process
•	I visited the official company website and located their verified recruiter team contact email.

•	I emailed them directly, asking if the job and recruiter were legitimate.

•	The company responded and confirmed that the job was fake and the recruiter did not represent them.


## Potential Impacts
•	Loss of credentials due to malware or sharing the same password from one of your other accounts when creating a job application account via their portal (if they do have one). 

•	Loss of data or damage to the computer and network via malware.

•	Financial fraud due to sharing personal information, which can be used to create loans or other financial products in an individual's name.


## Exposure
•	Fortunately, I didn't share anything personal like my SSN or banking details except for my resume, which doesn't hold anything more identifiable other than my city and state location, phone number, name, my email, LinkedIn profile, my GitHub, and where I am enrolled. While exposing my phone number, email, and name can be used maliciously, I am willing to accept the risk, given that it was intended to be public, and that I have safeguards in place to protect myself when bad actors are using that information.
      
## Lessons Learned
•	Even polished LinkedIn profiles can be fake or compromised.

•	Always verify domains and recruiter emails through official sources.

•	Scams can exploit real job listings to appear legitimate.

•	A job offer with no interview is a massive red flag. (See "Context & Reflection" below for more on this.)*

## Recommendations for Job Seekers
•	Always verify recruiter identities through official company websites or verified corporate emails.

•	Be cautious of job offers that come too quickly or don’t require any form of interview or skills validation.

•	Check the email domain; scammers often use unofficial or lookalike domains to appear legitimate.

•	Never send sensitive personal information (like SSNs, banking details, or photos of ID) until you've confirmed the employer's legitimacy.

•	Report suspicious accounts to:

    •  LinkedIn (use the “Report” option on the profile)

    •  The legitimate company being impersonated

    •  Federal Trade Commission (FTC) via ReportFraud.ftc.gov

    •  Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) via ic3.gov, especially for U.S.-based fraud

    •  Your country’s cybercrime reporting agency, if outside the U.S.


##      Context & Reflection
While receiving a job offer without an interview is typically a major red flag, I recognize that not every such case is necessarily a scam.

A few years ago, I accepted a legitimate job offer over the phone without an interview. The person sounded professional and didn’t ask for money, which lowered my suspicion. I did not verify the job or the individual through official company emails or domains. 
Instead, I relied solely on the phone number that contacted me. In hindsight, this was a risky move, but the job was real.

The role was overwhelming and disorganized; I suspect the lack of an interview was due to urgent hiring needs rather than standard practice.

This experience taught me that although no interview is usually a red flag, it is not definitive proof of a scam. It should always raise caution, especially when combined with unverifiable emails, offers that seem too good to be true, or communication outside official channels.

In this case study, the presence of multiple red flags, along with confirmation from the legitimate company, confirmed that the offer was indeed fraudulent.
